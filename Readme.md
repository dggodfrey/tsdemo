# Typescript Demo

The point of the demo is to show that Typescript provides a lot more benefits than plain JavaScript full of plugins. Typescript doesn't replace JS, it fills in the gaps of what we know as developers and what JS can infer by analyzing the code.

## Setup

VSCode is the best thing to use to compare. The reason is because VSCode is built using TS. That means we will be using basic TS against itself! I don't want the comparison to be fair. I want to give plain JS with all the tools as much of an edge as I can. We will also install several plugins to give VSCode an edge against TS.

Install these VSCode Plugins:
- Visual Studio IntelliCode
- React Extension Pack (it will install 7 plugins that will help with indexing and intellisense)

## Steps

There are several steps in the demo. Each branch will have its own set of steps and tasks to show how Typescript can help or hinder (I admit, it isn't perfect) and why you might consider using Typescript. Open [TODO.md](TODO.md) and start your journey!

### Outline

1. Setup/Detail/Walk-through with basic JS and plugins. 
2. Lets write some Typescript (basics)
   1. [Basic types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html)
   2. [Functions and Function Overloads](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/functions.html#overloads)
   3. Lets talk about Generics
3. Full project converted
   1. Lets try some of the problems we ran into in #1

## Acknowledgements

1. I will admit, limiting to one editor is a bit unfair. There are some tools built into the WebStorm products that may fill in some of these gaps. However, I think that highlights how TS can consistently fill those gaps between tools and editors. 
2. Why not use our code as an example? I could, but I don't want us to get caught up in implementation detail or perfect code. I also don't want any code anyone wrote to feel inferior. The point isn't to find problems, point out what is being done wrong, there is a better way, etc... The point is to show how TS helps. So, lets do it on some code that I wrote super poorly and we can just accept that the code is shit, imperfect, unimportant, and beat the crap out of it! For Science!
